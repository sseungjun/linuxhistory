Linux began in 1991 as a personal project by Finnish student Linus Torvalds    : to create a new free operating system kernel. The resulting Linux kernel     has been marked by constant growth throughout its history. Since the initia    l release of its source code in 1991, it has grown from a small number of C     files under a license prohibiting commercial distribution to the 4.15 vers    ion in 2018 with more than 23.3 million lines of source code, not counting     comments, under the GNU General Public License v2
 

After AT&T had dropped out of the Multics project, the Unix operating syst    em was conceived and implemented by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie (both o    f AT&T Bell Laboratories) in 1969 and first released in 1970. Later they re    wrote it in a new programming language, C, to make it portable. The availab    ility and portability of Unix caused it to be widely adopted, copied and mo    dified by academic institutions and businesses
